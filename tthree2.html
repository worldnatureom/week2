		<h1>Tawhid Al Uluhiyyah</h1>
	<p>Tawhid Al Uluhiyyah is the doctrine which testifies to the Godship of Allah. This implies that God ALONE is worthy of worship. And whoever directs worship to anyone other than Him, is a KAFIR. Thus, the one who directs obedience and worship to the Idols, graves, Prophets and other righteous people is an INFIDEL. Even if he testifies to the sole lordship of Allah.</p>

<h1>Proof of Tawhid Al Uluhiyyah</h1>

<div class= "pr1">Allah says: "You worship besides Allah nothing but idols, simply creating lies ˹about them˺. Those you worship besides Allah certainly cannot give you any provision. So seek provision from Allah ˹alone˺, worship Him, and be grateful to Him. To Him you will ˹all˺ be returned."
<br> Surah Ankabut; Aayah: 17</div>

<div class= "pr2">Allah mentions the story of Abraham where he said to his nation:"Shame on you and whatever you worship instead of Allah! Do you not have any sense?” <br> Surah Anbiya; Verse: 67</div>

<div class= "pr3">Allah tells, "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I call only upon my Lord, associating none with Him ˹in worship.” <br> Surah Jinn; Verse: 20</div>
