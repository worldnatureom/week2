		<h1>Tawhid Al Asma' Was Sifat</h1>
		
	<p> This form of Tawheed involves the Names and Attributes of Allah. This knowledge comes from the Quran and authentic reports. Allah often describes Himself in the Quran. In this way we learn who Allah is and how we can worship Him. His Names and Attributes are not not to be shared with anyone. For He is the Unique One that has no partners. It is therefore important to know the Names and Attributes of Allah. Allah has 99 Names like the narration of the Prophet confirms. His Beautiful Names are Unique and belong solely to Him. A Muslim will rewarded for memorising all His Names and acting upon them. </p>

<h1>Tawhid Al Asma Was Sifat in the Qur'an</h1>

<div class= "bobo">

<div class= "pr1">Allah says: "Allah, there is no god except He, The Ever-Living, The Superb Upright Sustainer." 
<br> Surah Aal e Imran; Aayah: 02</div>

<div class= "pr2">Allah  says again: "Allah! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining. Neither drowsiness nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who could possibly intercede with Him without His permission? He ˹fully˺ knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them, but no one can grasp any of His knowledge—except what He wills ˹to reveal˺. His Seat1 encompasses the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of both does not tire Him. For He is the Most High, the Greatest." <br> Surah Baqarah; Verse: 255</div>

<div class= "pr3">And He says: "And in no way did they estimate Allah His true estimate; and the earth all together will be His grasp on the Day of the Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His Right Hand. All Extolment be to Him, and Supremely Exalted be He above whatever they associate (with Him)!"  <br> Surah Zumar; Verse: 67</div>
